The MEV Sandwich Bot is a tool for automated profit generation on blockchains, leveraging sandwich attacks and other arbitrage strategies. It analyzes unconfirmed transactions in the mempool, generating profit by influencing token prices.

#### ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

Front-running: The bot places its transaction before a large user transaction.

Victimâ€™s Transaction: The userâ€™s main transaction goes through at an altered price.

Back-running: The bot sells tokens at the new price to capture profit.

#### ðŸ’¡ Key Benefits

Efficient unconfirmed transaction scanning: The bot detects profitable transactions in real-time.

Liquidity filtering and scam protection: Built-in filters avoid low-liquidity or suspicious tokens by using contract audits, e.g., through Scansniffer.
